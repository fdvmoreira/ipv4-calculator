# IPv4 Subnet Address Calculator

## Overview

This tool is designed to assist users in calculating IPv4 subnet addresses based on given IP addresses and subnet masks. It simplifies the process of determining the network and host portions of an IPv4 address within a specified subnet.

## Features

- Calculate the network address based on an IP address and subnet mask.
- Determine the broadcast address for a given IP address and subnet mask.
- Calculate the available host range within a subnet.

## How to Use

1. **Input IP Address and Subnet Mask:**
   - Provide an IPv4 address and its corresponding subnet mask.

2. **Calculate Network Address:**
   - Click the "Calculate Network Address" button to determine the network address based on the provided IP address and subnet mask.

3. **Calculate Broadcast Address:**
   - Click the "Calculate Broadcast Address" button to calculate the broadcast address for the given IP address and subnet mask.

4. **Calculate Available Host Range:**
   - Click the "Calculate Host Range" button to find the range of available host addresses within the specified subnet.
